#### Technologies Used:

*Libraries/Frameworks:*
time: For handling time-related functions.
tkinter (optional): For creating a graphical user interface (GUI).

#### Features:
1. Dynamic Time Display: Continuously updates and displays the remaining time in real-time.
2. Alert at Completion: Provides a sound or visual alert when the countdown ends.<br>
3.Input Flexibility: Allows users to input time in hours, minutes, and seconds.<br>
4.Customizable Appearance: Optional GUI can include color themes, fonts, and additional features like pause/reset buttons.

### 2. Task Saver (project_tasksaver.py) <br>
TaskSaver is a Python-based task management application that allows users to save, organize, and retrieve their tasks efficiently. It helps users stay productive by providing an easy-to-use interface for tracking daily to-dos, deadlines, and priorities.

#### Technologies Used:
*Libraries/Frameworks:* <br>
json: For storing and retrieving tasks in a structured format.<br>
tkinter: For building a graphical user interface (GUI).<br>
datetime: For handling task deadlines and timestamps.<br>

#### Features:<br>
Add Tasks: Quickly add tasks with descriptions and optional deadlines.<br>
View Tasks: Display all tasks in a list, sorted by priority or due date.<br>
Save and Load Tasks: Persist tasks using a JSON file to ensure data is saved between sessions.<br>
Mark as Complete: Mark tasks as done and remove them from the active list.<br>
User-Friendly Interface: Optional GUI with buttons for adding, viewing, and managing tasks.<br>
